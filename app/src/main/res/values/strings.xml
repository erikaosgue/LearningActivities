    <string name="duckInfo">
        Duck is the common name for numerous species in the waterfowl family Anatidae which also
        includes swans and geese. Ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the family Anatidae;
        they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common
        ancestral species) but a form taxon, since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks
        are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in
        both fresh water and sea water.

    <string name="parrotInfo">
        Parrots, also known as psittacines are birds of the roughly 398species in 92 genera comprising
        the order Psittaciformes found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The order is
        subdivided into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea (\"true\" parrots), the Cacatuoidea
        (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots). One-third of all parrot species are
        threatened by extinction, with higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than
        any other comparable bird group.[4] Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution
        with several species inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere, as well.
        The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America and Australasia.
